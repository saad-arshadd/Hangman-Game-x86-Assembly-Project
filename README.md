# 🎮 Hangman Game – x86 Assembly Project

This is a classic **Hangman word guessing game** developed using **x86 Assembly Language**, created as a system-level programming project. The goal is to guess the hidden word one letter at a time, with limited chances, all while understanding how low-level execution works on the x86 architecture.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Architecture:** x86 (16-bit)
- **Assembler:** TASM / MASM / NASM
- **Environment:** DOSBox or 16-bit compatible emulator
- **Language:** Intel-style Assembly (8086)

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Word selection and hidden display
- ✅ Character-by-character input
- ✅ Correct/incorrect guess feedback
- ✅ Remaining lives counter
- ✅ Game over and win messages
- ✅ Option to replay or exit

## 🔧 Assembly Concepts Applied

| Concept              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Registers**        | AX, BX, CX, DX for handling game logic |
| **Memory Access**    | Direct memory operations and addressing |
| **Loops & Jumps**    | Game flow using conditional and unconditional jumps |
| **INT 21h**          | For user input and output handling |
| **Stack Operations** | Simulated function call structure |

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Compile the assembly file using TASM/MASM/NASM.
2. Run the executable in **DOSBox** or a compatible environment.
3. Guess the word letter by letter.
4. You win if you guess all letters before running out of lives.
